# ERPNext website dark theme

Unfortunately, ERPNext does not currently have a dark theme available for their website. I created this dark theme for my own website. It took a lot of time to figure out all the different variables and to make sure that everything was changed. That is why I decided to upload it on Github. Feel free to use/edit it. 

I know the code is kinda messy, but it works.
